# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software
 create reliable software
 it helps manage cpmplexity
 it helps ensure quality


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of first programming languages made it easier for human to read and understand code
introduction of structured progamming made it easier to create complex program by reaking them into smaller maneageable pieces
emergence of object orented rogramming made it easy for developers to create re-usable code and manage large complex systems

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall method is Sequential %& structured while agile methodology is	Iterative & flexible
Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes
Agile is best suited for projects requiring flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
A software developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications. They translate business requirements into functional software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer
To ensure the quality and reliability of the software
Project Manager
To plan, execute, and monitor software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are indispensable tools in modern software development.

 They significantly enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality
 IDE - VS code
 VCS - Git hub

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are indispensable tools in modern software development.

 They significantly enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
